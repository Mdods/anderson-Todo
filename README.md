Remarks:
I enjoyed this submission, unfortunately due to time constraints,
i am unable to dedicate the full 4 hours to it. This app submission was
tested on one version of IoS phone due to lack of availability. 
things i would imporve on: 
Including a testing suite
Improving the styling
testing application functionality more in depth.
